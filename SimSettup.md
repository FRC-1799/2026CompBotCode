#Downloads:
newest wpilib vscode
newest NI game tools (if on windows)
newest code version from https://github.com/FRC-1799/2026CompBotCode/releases/

#Running the Simulator:
Open the newest version of the robot code in WPIlib vscode. 
Click the three dots at the top right and then click "simulate robot code".
Wait for the code to compile and then click continue when prompted.

If this does not work make sure that A) You are using WPIlib vscode and not normal vscode and B) The code is open in the correct directory (VScode should show files like build.gradle in the root directory).
